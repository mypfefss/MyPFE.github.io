# ConfPro 2025 — Single-page Conference Site

This is a minimal, modern single-page website scaffold for a professional conference.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small interactive scripts (smooth scrolling, mobile nav, form)
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple logo

How to view
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server).
2. For development, run a simple static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` in this directory and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

Notes
- The contact form is a front-end placeholder and does not submit to a backend.
- Responsive behavior includes a mobile menu toggle and smooth scroll accounting for the sticky header.

Next steps (optional):
- Add real speaker bios and images.
- Wire the registration form to a backend or service.
- Add SEO and meta previews for social sharing.
